# AngularJS for ASP.NET Developers

This sample shows the absolute basics of using AngularJS with ASP.NET.  I presented this topic to the NashDotNet user group in June of 2016. 

The sample app is an incident tracker for use by first-responders in the Zombie Apocalypse.  :) 

There are two branches you can use if you wish to follow along with the steps:+1:

* demo-start: This is the starting point, an ASP.NET app with no dependency on AngularJS.
* demo-end: This is the end of the demo, after AngularJS has been used to display a list of zombies.

There are commits along the way that show you the steps I took during the usergroup demo.
